Description of application:
	Our scheduling program comes with two files: OurFrame.java and Booking.java. OurFrame.java is the main class and Booking.java is an object created to help simplify the main class. To start the program put both of the files together and Run OurFrame.java. Once you run the program you will see our home page which gives a brief description of how to use the program: To request a time slot click on the "Request Time Slot" tab and enter in the information asked for on that tab and press the "Request Space" button. Once pressed the information you entered is sent to the "Principal" tab where the prinicpal can view all the requests via a drop box. The principal can then approve or deny a request by selecting an item in the drop box and pressing either the "Approve" or "Deny" buttons. If the selected item is approved it is added to the schedule on the "Schedule" tab and if the selected item is denied it is removed from the drop down box options.
	
	To code this application we itereated over the project feature by feature while testing the code after any change was made. We made use of the single responsiblity principal by adding an bookings class to simplfy code and add extensiblity. We also used anonmyous classes for our listeners to simplfy the code and make it more readable.
